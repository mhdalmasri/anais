# The Background icon folder

Put your SVG background-images you're referencing in your SCSS-files in here.

All SVG-files will be processed with svg2scss-task which creates a sass map containing the SVGs as data-URI strings.
Now you can include your svg icons by using the `_svg-background.scss` mixin. Just type `@include svg-background(name-of-your-icon);`.
